# 🚀 Neovim Config

This is my personal Neovim configuration, written entirely in Lua. It is designed to provide a fast, robust, and modern development experience, specifically optimized for TypeScript and JavaScript ecosystems. It includes full Debugging (DAP) support and seamless integration with CLI power tools.

### ✨ Key Features

- Fullstack Optimized: Fine-tuned for React, Node.js, and modern web development.
- Plugin Management: Powered by Lazy.nvim for a fast, modern, and efficient setup.
- Advanced Debugging: Pre-configured DAP (Debug Adapter Protocol) located in the /debugger directory.
- AI-Powered: Built-in support for GitHub Copilot.
- External Editor Integration: OpenCode plugin for seamless integration with VSCode and other editors.
- Terminal Integration: Smooth workflow with LazyGit, LazyDocker, and Zellij.

### Configurations dependencies:

- Node.js: We need to install Node.js to use some plugins like prettier, etc.
- C compiler: `bash sudo apt-get install build-essential`

### 📥 How to install:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/lucas-moraes/neovim-config.git

# 2. Move it to your Neovim configuration directory
# For Linux/macOS:
mkdir -p ~/.config
mv neovim-config ~/.config/nvim

# 3. Launch Neovim - lazy.nvim will auto-install on first run
nvim

```

> **Note**: On first launch, lazy.nvim will automatically install itself and all configured plugins. This may take a few moments.

## 🔌Core Plugins Core

**LSP**: Ready-to-use configs for TypeScript, ESLint, and JSON.</br>

## 📦 Plugin Management Commands

Lazy.nvim provides a clean UI and useful commands:

- `:Lazy` - Open the lazy.nvim UI to manage plugins
- `:Lazy update` - Update all plugins
- `:Lazy sync` - Install missing plugins and update existing ones
- `:Lazy clean` - Remove unused plugins
- `:Lazy check` - Check for plugin updates
- `:Lazy restore` - Restore plugins to their lockfile state
- `:Lazy profile` - Show detailed profiling information

## 🔗 OpenCode Integration

OpenCode provides quick access to external editors from within Neovim:

**Keybindings:**
- `<leader>oo` - Open current file in external editor (default: VSCode)
- `<leader>op` - Open entire project in external editor

**Commands:**
- `:OpenCode` - Open current file in configured external editor
- `:OpenCodeProject` - Open project root in configured external editor

The default editor is VSCode, but you can configure it in `lua/configs/plugins_config/opencode.lua` to use other editors like Sublime Text, Atom, or VSCode Insiders.
